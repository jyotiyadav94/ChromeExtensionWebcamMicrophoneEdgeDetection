The core functionality of the code can be found here. It draws inspiration from this repository: https://github.com/aiortc/aiortc/tree/main/examples/server.

I'm working on creating a Chrome extension that replicates the behavior of the API used in the project. However, I'm encountering an error with the fetch API inside the negotiate function in JavaScript, and Iâ€™m unsure about the root cause of the issue.

# Running the Code

You can run the code either through an API or a Chrome extension. Follow the instructions below for each method.

## 1. Running the Code through API

### Prerequisites
Ensure you have python installed  on your machine.

### Steps
1. **Navigate to the project directory:**

   ```bash
   cd TypeError-Failed-To-Fetch
   ```

2. ```bash 
   python server.py
   ```

This may take a few moments the first time you run it.

Open the application in your browser once Docker Compose is ready:

```bash 
http://127.0.0.1:8080
```

Select the options:

Choose "Use video"
Set resolution to 640 x 480
Select "Features detection"
Click on the "Start" button.
